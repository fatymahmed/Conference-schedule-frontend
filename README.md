# Conference schedule

> 
The react app allows 
- users to view available talks,
- logged-in users to add talks to their schedule,
- logged-in users to remove talks from their schedule,
- logged-in users to view their schedule.

The app also uses a Rails [API](https://events-scheduler-api.herokuapp.com), which can be found [here](https://github.com/fatymahmed/schedule-backend) that stores the data of the users, talks and schedules.
